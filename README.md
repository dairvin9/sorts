# Explanation

I guess it is weird to have a github repo of just data structures and algorithms. I took a Data Structures and Algorithms course and loved it- but then I had a couple semesters with classes that did not really have us programming, and most of my personal projects did not use these kinds of algorithms. I realized that, for a second, I could not remember how the quick sort algorithm worked. I played around in python and remembered it. So this repo is just filled with algorithms and data structures written without reference, so I can relearn/remember them. I learned most of these algorithms in c++, so it is also fun to write them in python. After I write them I look up the official version to compare and see what I could have done to be more efficient. 

## TLDR

This is a repo for me to play around and write algorithms. If you are looking for the official, most efficient way to write these things, look somewhere else :)
